/**
 * Question 15: GCD and LCM
 *
 * GCD (Greatest Common Divisor): Largest number that divides both numbers.
 * LCM (Least Common Multiple): Smallest number that is a multiple of both.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - GCD(12, 18) = 6
 * - LCM(4, 6) = 12
 *
 * Task: Write functions to find GCD and LCM of two numbers.
 *
 * Bonus: Find GCD/LCM of an array of numbers.
 */

function gcd(a, b) {
    // Your solution here
}

function lcm(a, b) {
    // Your solution here
}

// Test cases
console.log(gcd(12, 18)); // 6
console.log(gcd(48, 18)); // 6
console.log(lcm(4, 6)); // 12
console.log(lcm(3, 5)); // 15
