/**
 * Question 35: Implement Debounce and Throttle
 *
 * Debounce: Delays execution until after a period of inactivity.
 * Throttle: Limits execution to at most once per period.
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - Debounce: Search input, form validation, resize events
 * - Throttle: Scroll events, game loops, API rate limiting
 *
 * Task: Implement both debounce and throttle functions.
 */

function debounce(fn, delay) {
    // Your solution here
}

function throttle(fn, limit) {
    // Your solution here
}

// Test usage (conceptual - run in browser)
// const debouncedSearch = debounce(searchAPI, 300);
// const throttledScroll = throttle(handleScroll, 100);
