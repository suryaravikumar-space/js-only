/**
 * Question 11: Factorial
 *
 * The factorial of a non-negative integer n (denoted as n!) is the product
 * of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
 * - 0! = 1 (by definition)
 * - 1! = 1
 *
 * Task: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - Handle 0 and negative numbers appropriately
 */

function factorial(n) {

// Test cases
console.log(factorial(5)); // 120
console.log(factorial(0)); // 1
console.log(factorial(1)); // 1
console.log(factorial(10)); // 3628800
