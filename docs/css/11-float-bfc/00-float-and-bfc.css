/* ============================================================
   FLOAT, CLEAR & BFC — Legacy Layout + Important Concept
   ============================================================

   Float was the ORIGINAL way to create layouts before Flexbox/Grid.
   You don't need float for layout anymore, but you MUST know:
   1. How it works (legacy code exists everywhere)
   2. BFC (Block Formatting Context) — still very relevant

   ============================================================ */


/* --- float ---
   Takes element OUT of normal flow.
   Other content wraps around it.
   Originally designed for text wrapping around images.
*/

.image-left {
  float: left;
  margin-right: 1rem;
  /* Text flows around the right side */
}


/* --- The float problem ---
   Parent collapses when all children are floated
   because floated elements are "out of flow."
*/

.parent-broken {
  /* If all children float, this has 0 height! */
}

/* FIX 1: clearfix (old way) */
.clearfix::after {
  content: '';
  display: table;
  clear: both;
}

/* FIX 2: overflow (creates BFC) */
.parent-fixed {
  overflow: auto;   /* or overflow: hidden */
}

/* FIX 3: display: flow-root (modern, best) */
.parent-modern {
  display: flow-root;  /* creates BFC without side effects */
}


/* --- BFC (Block Formatting Context) ---
   A BFC is a mini layout environment where:
   1. Floats are contained (don't escape)
   2. Margins don't collapse across the boundary
   3. Content doesn't overlap floats

   Created by:
   - overflow: hidden/auto/scroll
   - display: flow-root (best)
   - display: flex or grid
   - position: absolute or fixed
   - float: left/right

   WHY IT MATTERS:
   - Prevents margin collapse between parent and child
   - Contains floated children
   - Prevents content from wrapping under floats
*/

/* Margin collapse prevention */
.parent {
  display: flow-root;  /* creates BFC */
  /* Now child's margin-top won't collapse with parent */
}
