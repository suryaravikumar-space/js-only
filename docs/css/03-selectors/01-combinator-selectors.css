   Selects ONLY direct children. Not grandchildren. */

/* --- Adjacent Sibling Selector + ---
   Selects the element IMMEDIATELY after (same parent, next sibling) */

   Selects ALL siblings that come AFTER (same parent) */

/* --- VISUAL ---

   <div>
     <h2>Title</h2>
     <p>First</p>     ← h2 + p selects THIS (adjacent)
     <p>Second</p>    ← h2 ~ p selects THIS too (general sibling)
     <span>Skip</span>
     <p>Third</p>     ← h2 ~ p selects THIS too
